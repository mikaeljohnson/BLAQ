    *   Notice the launcher address receives all the presale and liquidity tokens.
    *   Launch the presale address and pass in the contract address of the blaq token previously launched and the owner address for the blaq project
    *   Send all tokens to the presale address (70000000000000000000000000)
    *   Presale is live after "pauseRounds" is called with "false" passed in
    *   Each round will end when all tokens are sold and the presale will pause. "pauseRounds" will need to be called each round at the start to open it to presale
    *
    *
    *   Instructions to use:
    *   Make sure the presale is live
    *   Authorize presale contract to spend the funds you wish to buy with
    *   Enter the Integer amount of tokens you wish to buy into the "buyWith" function you wish to use and confirm transaction
    *   Contract will add the amount purchased to your vesting amount to be released after the presale Ends
    *
